# Multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors
This repository contains the ReactJS front-end of the game we built in week 7 at @Codaisseur Academy. It allows users to sign up, log in, create game rooms and play against each other.

The project combines our knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, ReactJS, Node.js, JWT authentication and Redux.

By @AndreeaCcss and @Mirtles

You will find the back-end [here](https://github.com/Mirtles/game-server).

##### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
